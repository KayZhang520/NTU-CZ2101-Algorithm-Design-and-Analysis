youtube video on dijkstra algorithm
- finding shortest path in directed weighted map from vertex A to B
- dijkstra is a procedure to find a shortest path
- works on directed and non-directed

relaxation:
- the constant updating of orignal distance to that of optimal path

-if there is no direct path, we preset dist as infinity
- go from root + 1 node, to +2 node, and set if we find a nearer path for any

----------------------------------------------------------

S: fully 'relaxed' vertices
V - S: yet to be 'relaxed' vertices
d: array of estimates for length of shortest from root to all vertices
pi: array of predecessors for each vertex, implemented as array containing v arrays each of size v

1. while V-S not empty:
	i. move V with shortest path from root over to S
	ii. anything directly connected should have their estimates of shortest distance re-evaluated
